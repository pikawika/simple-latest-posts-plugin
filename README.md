## Installation

> Coming soon

## Compatibility

This plugin was created for and tested with WordPress 4.9.8 and MariaDB 10.1.36 ran localy on a Windows 10 environment using XAMPP.

> - I used the default WordPress theme "Twenty Seventeen" and created 17 sample posts as dummy data.
> - Every post should have a title, description and a featured image.
> - I used the default "sample-page" to insert my shortcode and test the plugin.
> - I made the page layout One Column (setting under Theme Options).

Hence to the simplicity of this plugin it should work on older and newer versions of WordPress (online and/or offline) and any theme or page without a problem!
